Study Pad to take notes using java swing

!PLEASE NOTE - This application will only work on windows OS!

When the application is launched a user will be given three options:
  * Read tutorial
  * Make a new file
  * Search for an existing file

This application creates an interface similar to notepad, but there are some key differences.
The application was originally designed for users who want to take notes and then be able to store and
access their notes easily. Users will not have to worry about where they save files or what name to give 
files. Files are stored and searched by key-words that the user enters whe they finish a file. Additionally
files can also be searched by time period. This gives the advantage that when there is a large amount of 
notes taken, such as thousands of files, the user will have the ability to easily see a list of files that 
match certian keywords(up to three keywords) or files created within a certian time period.
To use app download the jar file.
